# Project Description:
- this project aims at classifying and predicting diabetes patients based on some features/symptoms included in the dataset using orange data mining too
- it uses 3 models as an example:
  - KNN
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- steps of the project:
  - download orange data mining tool [here](https://orangedatamining.com/download/)
  - once setup on your pc, download the dataset [here](https://github.com/AhmedEweed/orange-data-mining-project/blob/main/diabetes.csv)
  - follow the tutorials here for [Loading Diabetes Dataset into Orange Data Mining Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA2K9DheP7U)
  - follow the tutorials here for [Normalizing Diabetes Prediction Dataset in Orange Datadataset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzlvSDQ_NDE)
  - follow the tutorials here for [Machine Learning Models in Orange: Diabetes Prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ_jZPN5jlU)
  - follow the tutorials here for [Confusion Matrix & Predictions: Diabetes Prediction with Orange Data Mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEVtzbwkb_g)
  - once all done, you should have the final model file ready to go (you should open it with Orange Data Mining Tool)
